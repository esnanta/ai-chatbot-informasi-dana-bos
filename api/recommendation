Recommendations for Moving Forward with an MVP:

Clear Disclaimers: In your UI, include clear disclaimers that state the following:

"This chatbot is an early prototype and may not always provide accurate or complete answers."

"The chatbot's answers are based on the available regulatory documents and should not be considered legal advice."

"The chatbot may sometimes provide generic or repetitive answers."

Focus on Specific Use Cases: If possible, try to focus the chatbot on a few specific use cases or question types where it performs reasonably well. This will help you manage user expectations and get more targeted feedback.

Collect User Feedback: Include a feedback mechanism in your UI (e.g., a thumbs up/thumbs down button or a text box for comments) to gather user feedback on the chatbot's answers. This feedback will be invaluable for improving the chatbot in future iterations.

Monitor Performance: Carefully monitor the chatbot's performance and identify areas where it struggles. This will help you prioritize future development efforts.

Iterate Based on Feedback: Use the user feedback and performance data to iterate on the chatbot and improve its accuracy, specificity, and user experience.

Document Limitations: Create a document outlining the current limitations of the chatbot. This will help you communicate the chatbot's capabilities and limitations to stakeholders and users.

To summarize, the current performance is not ideal, but it's acceptable for an MVP if you're transparent about the limitations and have a plan for gathering feedback and iterating on the chatbot. You need to temper user expectations.
